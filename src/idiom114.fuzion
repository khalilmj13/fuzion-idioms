# Fuzion currently does not even define an equality operator for arbitrary
# types, so there is also no equality operator for deep equality.

# Equality is something that must be defined for a particular feature by
# implementing `equatable`, e.g., strings define equality as equality of all the
# bytes in the utf8 stream associated to a string.  A heir feauture of string
# may, however, define equality differently, it may even inherit repeatedly from
# `equatable` and rename 'infix =' to have several, different ways to partition
# instances into equivalence classes.
